# TODO / IDEAS

* Oil Refining processes and shipping
  * Process changes with time / level progression (?)
  * Ships / Boats / Tankers
  * Semitruck
  * Train
* Cities
  * Refinery nearby causes urban sprawl (?)
  * Different prices with cities
* Subtle climate change effects (?)
* Production of coal
* Worker wages (probably not)
  * Minimum wage
  * Unions
  * Stop increase of minimum wages by the government
* Lobbying
  * Spend certain money towards lobbying
* Refinery upgrades
* Start out dumping other gasses / side products that have no use (?)
* News feed marquee (?)
* Transport material from one area to another (?)

#NEW IDEAS POSTJUDGING
* Floating rafts/rigs
* Bacteria which are produced at a facility you can only have one of, and you can choose the 6 genes of each bacteria type produced. Changing the genes changes multiple aspects of the bacteria, so you will never have the perfect one with no downsides. Bacteria consume two materials and emit two by-products (one good and one bad). Bacteria can be stored in tanks and will reproduce automatically if there is water in the tank. Some bacteria can only live and reproduce in certain types of fluids.
* Speedboosting supermaterial
* Tunnels
* More complexity
